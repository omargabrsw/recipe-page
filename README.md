## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Clamp Generator](https://clamp.vittoretrivi.dev/) for CSS clamp() values

### What I learned

This is my second project, which I built mainly to revise HTML and CSS after taking a course. I found that building a project is the best way to reinforce my knowledge, rather than rewatching the course at double speed. It helped me practice and remember the concepts much more effectively.

### Continued development

I want to finish learning JavaScript so I can start working with frameworks like React and Next.js. After that, I plan to learn PHP and begin building headless WordPress websites, since I work at a WordPress development company. Since I started, I've learned a lot about how flexible WordPress can be and how I can bend it to my will.

### Useful resources

- [Clamp Generator](https://clamp.vittoretrivi.dev/) – Used for generating CSS `clamp()` values.
- [Elzero Web School](https://www.youtube.com/@ElzeroWebSchool) – I learned HTML and CSS from this YouTube channel.
